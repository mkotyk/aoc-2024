    "# Day 24: Crossed Wires\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "You and The Historians arrive at the edge of a large grove somewhere in the jungle. After the last incident, the Elves installed a small device that monitors the fruit. While The Historians search the grove, one of them asks if you can take a look at the monitoring device; apparently, it's been malfunctioning recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The device seems to be trying to produce a number through some boolean logic gates. Each gate has two inputs and one output. The gates all operate on values that are either true (1) or false (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "- AND gates output 1 if both inputs are 1; if either input is 0, these gates output 0.\n",
    "- OR gates output 1 if one or both inputs is 1; if both inputs are 0, these gates output 0.\n",
    "- XOR gates output 1 if the inputs are different; if the inputs are the same, these gates output 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gates wait until both inputs are received before producing output; wires can carry 0, 1 or no value at all. There are no loops; once a gate has determined its output, the output will not change until the whole system is reset. Each wire is connected to at most one gate output, but can be connected to many gate inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than risk getting shocked while tinkering with the live system, you write down all of the gate connections and initial wire values (your puzzle input) so you can consider them in relative safety. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x00: 1\n",
    "x01: 1\n",
    "x02: 1\n",
    "y00: 0\n",
    "y01: 1\n",
    "y02: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "x00 AND y00 -> z00\n",
    "x01 XOR y01 -> z01\n",
    "x02 OR y02 -> z02\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because gates wait for input, some wires need to start with a value (as inputs to the entire system). The first section specifies these values. For example, x00: 1 means that the wire named x00 starts with the value 1 (as if a gate is already outputting that value onto that wire).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second section lists all of the gates and the wires connected to them. For example, x00 AND y00 -> z00 describes an instance of an AND gate which has wires x00 and y00 connected to its inputs and which will write its output to wire z00.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, simulating these gates eventually causes 0 to appear on wire z00, 0 to appear on wire z01, and 1 to appear on wire z02.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the system is trying to produce a number by combining the bits on all wires starting with z. z00 is the least significant bit, then z01, then z02, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the three output bits form the binary number 100 which is equal to the decimal number 4.\n",

    "After inspecting the monitoring device more closely, you determine that the system you're simulating is trying to add two binary numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it is treating the bits on wires starting with x as one binary number, treating the bits on wires starting with y as a second binary number, and then attempting to add those two numbers together. The output of this operation is produced as a binary number on the wires starting with z. (In all three cases, wire 00 is the least significant bit, then 01, then 02, and so on.)\n",

    "The initial values for the wires in your puzzle input represent just one instance of a pair of numbers that sum to the wrong value. Ultimately, any two binary numbers provided as input should be handled correctly. That is, for any combination of bits on wires starting with x and wires starting with y, the sum of the two numbers those bits represent should be produced as a binary number on the wires starting with z.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have an addition system with four x wires, four y wires, and five z wires, you should be able to supply any four-bit number on the x wires, any four-bit number on the y numbers, and eventually find the sum of those two numbers as a five-bit number on the z wires. One of the many ways you could provide numbers to such a system would be to pass 11 on the x wires (1011 in binary) and 13 on the y wires (1101 in binary):\n",
