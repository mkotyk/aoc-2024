    "# Day 20: Race Condition\n",

    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The Historians are quite pixelated again. This time, a massive, black building looms over you - you're right outside the CPU!\n",
    "\n",
    "While The Historians get to work, a nearby program sees that you're idle and challenges you to a race. Apparently, you've arrived just in time for the frequently-held race condition festival!\n",
    "\n",
    "The race takes place on a particularly long and twisting code path; programs compete to see who can finish in the fewest picoseconds. The winner even gets their very own mutex!\n",
    "\n",
    "They hand you a map of the racetrack (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "###############\n",
    "#...#...#.....#\n",
    "#.#.#.#.#.###.#\n",
    "#S#...#.#.#...#\n",
    "#######.#.#.###\n",
    "#######.#.#...#\n",
    "#######.#.###.#\n",
    "###..E#...#...#\n",
    "###.#######.###\n",
    "#...###...#...#\n",
    "#.#####.#.###.#\n",
    "#.#...#.#.#...#\n",
    "#.#.#.#.#.#.###\n",
    "#...#...#...###\n",
    "###############\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The map consists of track (.) - including the start (S) and end (E) positions (both of which also count as track) - and walls (#).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program runs through the racetrack, it starts at the start position. Then, it is allowed to move up, down, left, or right; each such move takes 1 picosecond. The goal is to reach the end position as quickly as possible. In this example racetrack, the fastest time is 84 picoseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is only a single path from the start to the end and the programs all go the same speed, the races used to be pretty boring. To make things more interesting, they introduced a new rule to the races: programs are allowed to cheat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for cheating are very strict. Exactly once during a race, a program may disable collision for up to 2 picoseconds. This allows the program to pass through walls as if they were regular track. At the end of the cheat, the program must be back on normal track again; otherwise, it will receive a segmentation fault and get disqualified.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a program could complete the course in 72 picoseconds (saving 12 picoseconds) by cheating for the two moves marked 1 and 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
